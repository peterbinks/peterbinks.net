Paul Miller of The Verge has left the Internet for a year. Here is the first day.


  I think there are two kinds of people who live with technology constantly in their face: people who freak out when they're forcefully separated from their devices or connectivity, as if their arm has been cut off, and people who feel really chill when they're forcefully separated from their devices or connectivity, as if they've been let out of prison. I've spoken to many of both kinds as I've prepared for leaving the internet, and thankfully I fall in the latter camp.


This sounds really interesting. Sure, there are a bunch of people that think that this is a just a publicity stunt, and stupid, I like the idea and the reason for him doing it.
