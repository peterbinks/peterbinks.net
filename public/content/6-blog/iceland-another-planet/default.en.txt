Title: Iceland: Another Planet

----

Text: 

I'm still decompressing from my trip, and I need to write things down before to process. I spent four days in Iceland, and in that time, my friends and I traveled the entire country on the the Ring Road. It's the main highway that literally rings around the entire island, and here are some tips and pictures. Hopefully its helpful. 

## Flights

For cheap flights, check out Wow Airlines and Skyscanner.com. I got my ticket after my friends texted me that they already bought theirs, I check and found a ticket out of Boston to Keflavik for 150$! Which I instantly bought. You can find some amazing deals.

## Rent A Car

Seriously. Don't use tour busses or anything. Rent. And splurge on the 4x4 SUV. It will be a life saver, and give you so much mobility. 

## Reykjavik

The capital is nice, though I didn't spend too much time there. The Hallgr√≠mskirkja church is a great place, and definitely worth the trip to the top to see the entire city. There are great restaurants all around. Be sure to check out Reykjavik roasters. Definitely the best cup of coffee in the country. If you're going to spend more than a day in the city. Definitely check out some hostels, and Airbnb has some pretty great deals as well.

## On the road

My friends and I drove around the Ring Road, otherwise known as Route 1. Literally it rings around the entire island, and basically is your best bet to see most of the country.
