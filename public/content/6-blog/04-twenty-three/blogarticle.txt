6. Free pizza is good pizza
7. "Please" and "Thank You" make a difference
8. Say nothing if you can't say something nice.
9. Stop comparing yourself to others, there will always be someone who is better than you at something
10. And someone who is worse than you at something
11. Strive to be the person you needed when you were younger
12. Hating things is boring, talk about the things you love
13. The only difference between you and a professional, is that a professional calls them self one
14. Happiness > money
15. Sometimes money can enable happiness (or peace of mind)
16. Learn the difference between their, there, and they're
17. As well as your and you're
18. Confidence is everything
19. Genuine kindness is undervalued
20. Pet cats as often as you can
