It's interesting that a man so few had met, and fewer still could claim to have befriended, put this kind of impact on the world. I myself was shocked and greatly saddened to learn of Steve's death. I still remember the first time I laid eyes on a apple product, iPod 3rd generation, and how I knew I had to have it. Subsequently, I knew I just HAD to get an apple computer, and even though it took a couple year to get there, I am now typing this on my trusty 08' MacBook Pro.

Here's a list of amazing website tributes to steve from around the internet.
Enjoy.
