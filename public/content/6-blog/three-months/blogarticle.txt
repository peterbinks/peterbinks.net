You know three months can see like an eternity or an hour.  It really depends on what you're doing with them. 

The last three months I've been dating one of the most wonderful ladies on the planet, and that tends to compress time a bit. It feels like just yesterday she condescended to date me.

It was in Grant Park for the curious.

Yet, it also feels like an eternity. As if I can't remember what my life was like before nightly calls, and good morning texts.  

I'm going to always be thankful for this hour, for this eternity. I'm not sure when I'll see her again (though I might have an idea or two), but I'll try to learn to be content with what I have been given. It's a gift, and I intend to treasure it.
