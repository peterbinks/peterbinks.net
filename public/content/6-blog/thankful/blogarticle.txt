I've never written a "thanksgiving" post. Well I haven't written many posts, but that's beside the point.

I always found posting on your blog about the things that you're thankful for to be a bit quaint and perhaps a bit plastic. As if publicly sharing them with strangers on the internet takes away from what makes you thankful in the first place. 

Since I'm on a blogging kick though:

I am thankful for several things this year. 


Shelter
Food
Family
Friends
Work
Coffee
Melody 


I try to enjoy the simple things. And that is where you see how blessed you truly are.
