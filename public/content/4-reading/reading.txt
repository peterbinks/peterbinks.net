Design Is A Job gave me a whole new outlook on my profession as a freelance designer, and I'm sure this one will be similarly poignant.</p>

(img: 2014-09-11-on-web-typography-cover.jpg height: 300 class: pull-left book-cover)<p> I love everything typography. If i was more skilled, I'd probably a typographer. As it is, this is an excellent resource for typography in general as well as specifically for the web.</p>

(img: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71%2BJiq31emL.jpg	 height: 300 class: pull-left book-cover)<p>The end of one of the best modern fantasy series. The first book was so captivating, and the main character was so relatable that I read it three time in a week. I have high hope for the climax of the trilogy.</p>
