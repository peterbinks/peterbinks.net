##What I Can Do For You

###Web Design & Development

You need an updated look. You need a site that works on phones and tablets. You need something that **_simply_** and **_clearly_** states information about your business. I'm the guy to help you with that. I'll set up a site that is easy to use, update, and maintain yourself (or i can do that for you), and delivers real results in increased traffic and user experience for your customers. 

###Branding & Logo

Your brand is how you communicated to your customers. From the logo it self, to your colors, typography, and tone of voice, are all part of your brand. I'm here to make sure your brand is as effective as possible to communicating the right message to your customers.

##My Process

###1 - Strategy

Before the design process begins, I will collect information about your business and brand so that I can understand your story and make sure we’re on the same page. Together, we will strategize & gather inspiration, which in turn, will reveal how to develop and communicate your message truthfully.

###2 - Design

Taking the information and inspiration we’ve gathered, I will spend time developing solid design concepts for your project. Once the initial designs have been presented, we will work back and forth to help finalize everything and make sure that each part is in line with your vision. 

###3 - Build & Realization

More often than not, client projects are multi-dimensional. This means that we will take your brand and implement it into various formats to cover your additional needs. Whether it’s a website or other marketing materials, we will consistently build out your brand.
