Text: I've been defeated. I'm going back to school and giving up on working full-time as a web designer. For the time being at least. 

For the last 6 months I've been applying everywhere. I've tried (link: http://honestdesign.co text: working for myself) (which I'm still going to be doing, hopefully.). I've looked for internships, full-time, part-time, anything really and I haven't found it. It's like the universe is pushing me into the waiting embrace that is all-nighters, group-projects, and class speeches.

Everything on the internet nowadays is saying not to! Too much debt! Waste of time! Outdated courses! Everything! But in the end, college still gives you a major leg up. First, even though many companies are no-longer requiring a degree, it never hurts. Second, connections. It is so much easier to get internships and your leg in the door at your first "real" job. 

So that's it. Hello Columbia. (hopefully)
