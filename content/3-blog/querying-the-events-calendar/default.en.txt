Title: SPPL - Handling Events

----

Text: 

I'm in the middle of rebuilding/designing/developing the Schiller Park Public Library's website. The current one is mostly a bunch of hacks thrown together, and I want to do it right.

One problem thing that I did wrong from the beginning was not using custom post types. There are several different post types that the library need. New Item (books, music, movies) as well as our Programs (events). For the current site I just put them all as regular posts, and split them up by category. And I've reached the limit of that method.

So for the programs we do, I decided to go with Modern Tribe's, Events Calendar Plugin. However the first problem I ran into was the last of shortcodes to display events in places other than the /events page. So off to write a custom query it was. But wait, again, I wasn't finding any good examples of the queries. So I'm posting mine for future reference.  Here, I'll break down whats going on:
