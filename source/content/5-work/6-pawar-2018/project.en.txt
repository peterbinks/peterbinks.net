Title: Pawar 2018

Text: 

As part of Ameya Pawar's digital volunteer team for his 2018 gubernatorial bid, I built out and launched pawar2018.com. Built on Wordpress, I was responsible for setting up the admin area for site (as the person with the most wordpress experience) as well as the front-end development of various sections of the site.
