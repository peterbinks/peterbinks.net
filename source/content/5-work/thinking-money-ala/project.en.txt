Title: Thinking Money

----

Text: 

In the first half of 2016 I worked with the American Library Association to produce an interactive iPad experience for their Thinking Money traveling exhibition. 

Th project consisted of using web technologies inside of Apache Cordova to produce a native iOS app. I used animation and data visualization libraries like D3.js, GSAP, as well as HTML5 components, CSS3 animations, and plain Javascript to build this app.
