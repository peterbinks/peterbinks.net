I lead the front end development on the new (link: http://www.uwsheltermedicine.com/ text: University of Wisconsin Shelter Medicine) website. It runs on Ruby on Rails and it's content is maintained using a custom CMS. We used SASS (specifically SCSS) as the CSS pre-processor. (link: http://foundation.zurb.com/ text: Foundation) is used for grid layout, and Javascript plugins primarily. We use Git with Gitlab for our version control.
