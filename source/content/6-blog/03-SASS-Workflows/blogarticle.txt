Title: SASS Workflows

----

Text: A lot has been written about SASS workflows. But I've never found something that works for my situations, which I thought a lot more people would relate to.

As a freelancer, I frequently just set up a sub folder on my FTP server to develop on. The biggest advantage of this is that I can collaborate with my clients in real-time. They see what I see. And, since the development team is just me, I don't use testing servers, development environments, all that. I used to start off my projects locally and use MAMP, but when I want to update the client on my progress, what to do? The most straight forward thing is toss the site to a live server. 

SASS has been difficult to implement into my workflow. Working locally with it is a dream, but editing CSS files that are on a server just gets way to complicated way to fast. I've read a bunch of articles and looked through a lot of documentations, but I just recently found a way to do this simply and easily.

I just found (link: http://blog.rainbird.me/post/41730281659/using-sass-with-codekit-transmit-remote-stylesheets text: this post) by (link: https://twitter.com/rainerbird text: William Rainbird). Basically you can mount any FTP server to your computer, using (link: http://panic.com/transmit text: Transmit), and then use sass installed on your computer to watch the files on the server and automatically update the CSS. This is my key to using SASS full time. 

Now one of these days I might start using Compass, and Bourbon, and everything else I'm supposed to use as a front-end dev.
