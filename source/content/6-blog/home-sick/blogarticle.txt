There is something that I have noticed in my “home sickness”. I fluctuate wildly between really wanting to go back home and staying here. Specifically I think about certain routines or events back in Chicago; getting some Gene &amp; Judes, biking around, going to J Bean or Starbucks. The people that I know, and the places that I love.

I wonder however if this is true home-sickness (for lack of a better term) am I really and truly in love with Chicago? Or, am I simply living in the past and liking what I see there.

Questions without answers. Thats all I have for now. Hopefully I’ll learn more of the difference before I go back in a month.
