Joshua Topolsky on the new Ice Cream Sandwich Galaxy Nexus


  Since day one, I've been waiting for an Android device that lived up to the promise of such a powerful OS. I think I can stop waiting now.


This looks seriously killer.

I recently switched back to an iPhone 3g when I dropped my Nexus S on tile, and the display shattered. It was a very sad day. Though I have to say the only advantage, if this review pans out in real life, is the first party apps in IOS.  Instapaper, Instagram, Tweetbot, Reeder. These are apps that I really love, even if they perform like crap on my 3g. Android doesn't have that. I have to say. Those apps are the only advantage at this point. Hopefully soon this will change with ICS

However since I am stuck on T-Mobile for the next year and a half, I would much rather get a phone that can use T-Mobile's 3g data speeds. I might try to replace the display of my Nexus or maybe try to score a new one from Best Buy. The 3g is just too slow.
