Like Thanksgiving posts, New Year's resolution posts have always seemed slightly trite to me. Resolutions in general get a bad rap. "It's just another day" "They never work" etc...

Well one reason I can think of why people make resolution for the upcoming year on Jan 1st is that its an easy way of keeping track of the time. Well whatever. I only have one resolution.

Be a better me.

That includes:


Be nicer to people
Live healthier
Never stop learning
Read more
Think more
Love more


Happy New Year everyone. I hope 2013 is a blast.
