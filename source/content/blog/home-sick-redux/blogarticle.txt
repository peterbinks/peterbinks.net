Why are people so prone to nostalgia? Sometimes we miss things/people/places that don't really matter. We try to live our lives the best we can, we try to make meaningful conections, and then we try to keep something for our selves from every experience and every moment.

By nature we humans are a selfish bunch. Its wasn't even two  chapters into the Good Book, and we already have man choosing to go down in flames to keep the one thing that God had given him. Adam could have easily said no, he knew what was up, he could smell what Eve was stepping in, but if he refused her he knew she would be cast out and he would stay, without her. He couldn't take it. And look where we ended up. Harsh much? Well yeah... Sorta.

Ok. Perhaps thats taking the analogy too far.

But think about it. We constantly try to keep everything around the same, never changing, always permenant, and we fail.

Over and over.

Thats when we go to lengths we never would have thought before. But if we just stop to think about it. Is change all that bad? What's the worse that can happen? Sometimes, change is the only thing that can save us from our selves.

And, so, I've realized from my last post that, no, I'm not really and irrevocably attached to Chicago. Sure, I like it.  I love the city, the people, my friends, the atmosphere. But these things don't comfort and sustain me.

So.
