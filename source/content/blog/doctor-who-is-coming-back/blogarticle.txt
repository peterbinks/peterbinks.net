Yes! Doctor who is returning on March 30th.

Honestly I was a bit disapointed in how Amy and Rory "left" the series, but I am super pumped about Clara Oswin Oswald. She's been my favorite character, as seen in Asylum of the Daleks and Snowmen ,Â throughout Eleven's run, with River coming in a close second.
