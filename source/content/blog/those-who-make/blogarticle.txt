Oddly Correct is a coffee roaster in Kansas City, Mo. Just one of my favorite videos from the "Those Who Make" channel on Vimeo.

I love these kinds of videos, really any kind of stories, that document the process of a thing. Process has always fascinated me; whether be it how you make your morning coffee, how To Build A Fire, or how a writer writes.
