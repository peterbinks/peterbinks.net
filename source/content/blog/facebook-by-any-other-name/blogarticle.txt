Google+ has been rolled out for a while now. At first it was only available to the select few. The uber geeks, and the trend setters — journalists — were the first to try it out and cautiously optimistic reviews ensued (okay only one review). Then more invites started flooding people's inboxes, people got their actual friends on the service to see how it would work in their real social-networking flow.

It's obvious that G+ has to sink or swim on its own merits. It seems that G+ caters to very unique subset of users. These users, seem to be more of the tech-obsessed persuasion. And it also seems that G+ has more in-depth discussions that Facebook usually sees (at least from my "stream").

If you think Facebook is the greatest thing since sliced bread, then you will in all likely hood enjoy Google+, if you dislike Facebook knowing everything about you and being your digital big brother, then you won't much like Google+. Probably even less so, seeing to how Google is in the business of collecting your personal information and selling it to advertisers — see Google+ and "Privacy".

Now that I am on G+, I am finding the UX interesting and delightful. The Circles concept is so much better implemented than Facebook Groups that its a wonder why anyone would use Groups. The privacy settings (with other users) is very clear, and easy to use. And I have to admit that its nice to be on a new frontier where there aren't spammers and worse. It is nice to be part of the cutting edge of geekdom, there's a sort of "exclusivity" to it. Everyone and their grandmothers dog is not on it, and that is one thing that is very compelling to me personally.

One last thing, as Oliver Reichenstien pointed out, G+ is quickly making Facebook feel like MySpace. There is now way around it, Facebook feels clunkier, there are more things distracting you from the primary purpose - connecting with friends — than ever before. It's outdated, and simply not the cool place any more. Will this lead to Facebook's demise? I'm not sure, but I do think that Google+ will soon become as essential to people as Twitter, or Instagram, and in time, it might just take down Goliath.
